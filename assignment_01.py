# This program gets three test scores and displays their average.  It congratulates the user if the 
# average is a high score. The high score variable holds the value that is considered a high score.

# Calculate the average test score.
# Add the bracket around the three variables
average = (test1 + test2 + test3 )/ 3
# Print the average.
print('The average score is', str(average))
# If the average is a high score,
# congratulate the user.

#The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles and prints to the user the area of both rectangles.

#Q3 
#Ask a user to enter their first name and their age and assign it to the variables name and age. 
#The variable name should be a string and the variable age should be an int.  

# Asking for the name of the user

#Using the variables name and age, print a message to the user stating something along the lines of:
# "Happy birthday, name!  You are age years old today!"
